## Tech
- [sqlc](https://docs.sqlc.dev/en/latest/overview/install.html)
- [go_migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate)
- [grpc](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/)

## Aditional Configs
### Go Migrate
You can download and to use CLI on your own machine, but you may change commands in this Makefile, switch ./migrate to migrate.
In this repo I use migrate file from [migrate repository](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/tree/master/cmd/migrate), see [migrate release downloads](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/releases) to get binaries file from your system and arch

### GRPC
May you must install some extensions for go, see [quick start grpc with go](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/)
